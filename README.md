# What is Money Leash?

Money Leash is a Personal Expense App developed in Ionic 2/Angular 2 with a Firebase backend. This project is a complete rewrite from the ground up of the original [MoneyLeash repo](https://github.com/gigocabrera/moneyleash) developed in ionic 1.

I discovered the Ionic Framework back in April 2015 and I became addicted almost immediately. This app is a work in 
progress and the result of the itch I had to get out of my comfort zone and experiment with new technologies. Money Leash 
will stay as an **open source** project. Your feedback/help would be greatly appreciated!

## Quick Start

- Clone this repository.
- Run `npm install` from the project root.
- Run `ionic serve` in a terminal from the project root

You may also need to:

- Delete the platform/ios folder and run `ionic build ios` so that the platform and all the plugins where installed by the build process.

- Need to install `ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-app-version`


## Firebase Data Structure

The database structure gets built automatically by the app when you register a new user. No need to manually buld the schema.

## Firebase Security and Rules

The Firebase Security Rules for MoneyLeash can be found in the Gist below. 
A user is granted access (read/write) by house_id and the security rules have been tested to guarantee no unauthorized access is allowed. 
However, the rules need to be enhanced to: (1) prevent users from modifying a house_id, 
(2) for a newly created account, the user needs to logout and log back in for the rules to work
